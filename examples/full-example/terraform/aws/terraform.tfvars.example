# Development:
#   t3.large     (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM)    - Small dev/test

# Production - Balanced:
#   m5.xlarge    (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM)   - Small production
#   m5.2xlarge   (8 vCPU, 32GB RAM)   - Standard production
#   m5.4xlarge   (16 vCPU, 64GB RAM)  - Large production
# Production - Memory-optimized:
#   r5.xlarge    (4 vCPU, 32GB RAM)   - Memory-intensive
#   r5.2xlarge   (8 vCPU, 64GB RAM)   - Heavy memory workloads
# Production - Storage-optimized:
#   i3.xlarge    (4 vCPU, 30.5GB RAM) - High I/O with NVMe
